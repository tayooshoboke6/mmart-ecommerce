# TODO List for Checkout Mmart

## High Priority

### Fix CSV Export Functionality
- **Issue**: 500 Internal Server Error when exporting orders with filters
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Details**: 
  - The export functionality in `Admin\OrderController.php` is encountering an error when trying to generate CSV files
  - Initial debugging shows the error might be related to missing fields in order items or issues with relationship loading
  - Currently returns a 500 error with an HTML response instead of the expected CSV file
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Added fallbacks for product_name in order items
  - Enhanced eager loading of relationships
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Refactored the CSV generation process to use chunking for better memory management
- **Next Steps**:
  - Check Laravel logs for detailed error messages
  - Verify database schema for orders and order_items tables
  - Test with a single order export to isolate the issue
  - Consider implementing a queue-based approach for large exports

## Medium Priority

### Enhance Error Handling in Frontend
- Improve error feedback in the Orders.js component
- Add more detailed error messages for users
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls

## Low Priority

### Optimize CSV Export Performance
- Implement background processing for large exports
- Add progress indicators for users
- Consider adding email notification when export is complete
